This is an online map of Middle Earth.  The front-end is entirely static on
[http://3rin.gs/](3rin.gs) posted from the www/ directory.  The static content is
generated with the tile script and the Python Imaging Library.

The raster graphics are not included in this repository on account of their
size.  These will be posted on the 3rin.gs site eventually.  However, the
SVG graphics are included here and can be mined for useful information to
generate new layers.
