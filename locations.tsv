Valandil's heirs eventually moved their seat to Fornost (Kings' Norbury).  In The Two Towers, it is mentioned that the lore of Elrond's house tells that one of the palantiri was in Annúminas.  The index of The Lord of the Rings and the Unfinished Tales both mention that the palantiri of Annúminas, Amon Sûl, and Elostirion were lost when Arvedui perished in a shipwreck in the Ice Bay of Forochel. On this map, Annúminas is represented by a tower, the existence of which is conjecture, based on the name and that it was common for palantiri to be housed in watch towers."
